# Image Colorization: A Comparitive Study

Colorization of grayscale images is an ill-posed problem, with multiple correct solutions. Although important progress has been made in this field, over the time multiple models have been implemented to solve this problem which have been improvised over the time. 

We compare 3 models in detail:

1. [Deoldify](https://github.com/jantic/DeOldify)
2. [Instance-Aware Image Colorization](https://github.com/ericsujw/InstColorization)
3. [ChromaGAN](https://github.com/pvitoria/ChromaGAN)
